## building-blocks
This project is part of the Odin Project which can be found here https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/advanced-building-blocks 


========================================================

There are two folders in this repositories. The bubble sort folder contains an implementation of the bubble sort algorithm in ruby. The enumerable folder contains my own implementation of ruby enumerables such as 'each', 'map', 'count', 'any?', 'none?', 'inject', 'all?'

NB: To test the code in this project  you need to have ruby installed
